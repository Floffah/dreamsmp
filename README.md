Play/streaming times for all the DreamSMP members

## Setup
Set the `ip` env variable to the Minecraft server IP you wish to track

`dburi` env variable to the MongoDB uri

set the `twitch_client_id` and `twitch_token` env variables to your Twitch API client id and token.



Make sure to set `youtube` and/or `twitch` values as the user's YouTube/Twitch IDs in the `players` collection (Twitch ids are numerical, YouTube IDs are what comes after the /c/ in the url)
